This is the hardware source tree of the Aquila SoC.

To create a complete Xilinx Vivado project workspace, simply download
the source tree to a local directory, then run the following command
under a DOS or Linux console:
```
C:\> <<Vivado Installation directory>>/bin/vivado.bat -mode batch -source build.tcl
```
The created project workspace will be in the directory aquila_soc/.
Note that, the tcl script, build.tcl, for project creation was exported
from Vivado 2018.2.
